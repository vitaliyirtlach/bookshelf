## Bookshelf
The application is built from scratch using a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://ru.reactjs.org/) with a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). This is an application for publication of information about books: cover, dip, author, date of release and much more with some CSS preprocessor like [scss/sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
